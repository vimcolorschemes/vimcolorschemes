# Code of Conduct

* **Be mindful of your language.** Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.
* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
* **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.
* **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [contact@reobin.dev](mailto:contact@reobin.dev). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.
